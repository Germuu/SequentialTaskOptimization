## Abstract
Car washing businesses face the challenge of maximizing throughput while managing labor costs and minimizing time spent on each vehicle. In this report, we introduce a new approach to improve car wash operations by optimizing task allocation between workers. Our method focuses on the principle of task specialization, where workers are divided into teams based on their strengths, and the process is balanced to minimize bottlenecks. This approach can significantly increase the number of cars washed per hour, resulting in reduced costs and improved customer satisfaction.

## Introduction
In the car wash industry, the key to success is efficiency. The faster a car wash operation can process a vehicle, the higher the throughput, leading to more customers served and greater profits. However, car washes often struggle with inefficiencies caused by imbalanced task allocations. For example, workers typically perform all tasks (vacuuming, wiping, pressure washing) without focusing on their individual strengths.

This document presents a new method to optimize car wash operations. By dividing workers into specialized teams and focusing on reducing bottlenecks, our approach helps car washes achieve a significant increase in throughput.

## The Problem
A typical car wash process involves several steps:
1. Vacuuming
2. Wiping
3. Pressure washing (if needed)

Each of these tasks takes a certain amount of time. The challenge arises when the time it takes to complete one task exceeds the time needed for others. For example, vacuuming can become irrelevant if the bottleneck in the process is the wiping or pressure washing steps, which take longer.

Many car wash operations are still using a traditional approach where each worker completes the entire process on their own. This results in inefficient task allocation, and often leads to unnecessary waiting times and reduced throughput.

## Our Solution: Task Specialization and Optimization
We propose a new approach that maximizes car wash throughput by dividing workers into specialized teams. In each team, the fastest vacuumers focus on vacuuming, while other workers handle wiping and pressure washing tasks. This division of labor ensures that each worker is focusing on what they do best, reducing bottlenecks and speeding up the entire process.

### Key Concepts
- **Task Specialization**: Workers focus on specific tasks based on their efficiency.
- **Bottleneck Identification**: By analyzing the time taken by each task, we can identify when vacuuming time becomes irrelevant due to a bottleneck created by wiping or pressure washing.
- **Throughput Optimization**: Our method reduces overall car wash time by balancing the tasks, ensuring that no single step creates unnecessary delays.

## The Model
We have developed a mathematical model to calculate the number of cars washed per hour, both for the current method (individual work) and the proposed method (task specialization).

Let:
- $T_v$ = Average vacuuming time per car (in minutes)
- $T_w$ = Average wiping time per car (in minutes)
- $p$ = Probability of needing pressure washing
- $T_p$ = Average pressure washing time per car (in minutes)
- $N$ = Number of workers

### Current Method: Individual Work
In the current method, each worker completes the entire process on their own. The throughput (cars washed per hour) is given by:

$$
\text{Cars per hour (current)} = \frac{60}{T_v + T_w + p \times T_p} \times N
$$

### Proposed Method: Task Specialization
In the proposed method, workers are divided into teams, with the fastest vacuumers focusing on vacuuming and others handling wiping and pressure washing. The throughput is calculated as:

$$
\text{Cars per hour (proposed)} = \frac{60}{T_j} \times \frac{N}{2}
$$
where $T_j$ is the vacuuming time of the fastest vacuumers.

## Deriving the Efficiency Condition
The proposed method is considered more efficient if it results in a higher throughput than the current method. Therefore, we set up the following inequality:

$$
\frac{60}{T_j} \times \frac{N}{2} > \frac{60}{T_v + T_w + p \times T_p} \times N
$$

### Step 1: Simplify the Inequality
We can cancel $60$ and $N$ from both sides, giving:

$$
\frac{1}{T_j} > \frac{2}{T_v + T_w + p \times T_p}
$$

### Step 2: Rearrange to Solve for $T_j$
Multiplying both sides by $T_j$ and the combined time $(T_v + T_w + p \times T_p)$, we get:

$$
T_j < \frac{T_v + T_w + p \times T_p}{2}
$$

This inequality shows that for the proposed method to be more efficient, the vacuuming time of the fastest vacuumers $T_j$ must be less than half of the total average time for vacuuming, wiping, and the weighted pressure washing time. In other words, $T_j$ should be small enough to reduce the bottleneck effect in vacuuming and allow wiping or pressure washing to become the limiting factor.

---

## Results
Through our analysis, we find that the proposed method can increase throughput by up to **33%** under ideal conditions. This increase is achieved by better utilizing the strengths of each worker and reducing bottlenecks that typically slow down the process.

The efficiency increase is most noticeable when vacuuming time ($T_j$) is optimized. However, once $T_j$ becomes very small (i.e., faster than the combined time for wiping and pressure washing), the throughput stabilizes due to the bottleneck created by the latter tasks.

---

## Conclusion
By introducing task specialization and focusing on balancing bottlenecks, our optimization method significantly improves car wash throughput. This leads to greater efficiency, lower operational costs, and increased customer satisfaction. Car wash companies adopting this approach can expect a substantial return on investment, with potential efficiency increases.

We encourage car wash businesses to consider adopting this optimized model to stay ahead of the competition and maximize their operational performance.
